PGObject::Util::DBAdmin - PostgreSQL Database Management Facilities for
PGObject

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.131.0

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides an interface to the basic Postgres db manipulation
utilities.

 my $db = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new(
    username => 'postgres',
    password => 'mypassword',
    host     => 'localhost',
    port     => '5432',
    dbname   => 'mydb'
 );

 my @dbnames = $db->list_dbs(); # like psql -l

 $db->create(); # createdb
 $db->run_file(file => 'sql/initial_schema.sql'); # psql -f

 my $filename = $db->backup(format => 'c'); # pg_dump -Fc

 my $db2 = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new($db->export, (dbname => 'otherdb'));

$db->stdout and $db->stderr respectively.

Croaks on error. Returns true on success.

Recognized arguments are:

=over

=item file

Path to file to be run. This is a mandatory argument.

=item stdout_log

Provided for legacy compatibility. Optional argument. The full path of
a file to which STDOUT from the external psql utility will be appended.

=item errlog

Provided for legacy compatibility. Optional argument. The full path of
a file to which STDERR from the external psql utility will be appended.

=back

=cut

sub run_file {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    $self->{stderr} = undef;
    $self->{stdout} = undef;

    croak 'Must specify file' unless defined $args{file};
    croak 'Specified file does not exist' unless -e $args{file};

    # Build command
    my @command = ('psql', '--set=ON_ERROR_STOP=on', '-f', $args{file});

    my $result = $self->_run_command(
        command    => [@command],
        errlog     => $args{errlog},
        stdout_log => $args{stdout_log},
    ) or croak 'error running command';

    return $result;
}


=head2 backup

Creates a database backup file.

After calling this method, STDOUT and STDERR output from the external
utility which runs the file on the database are available as properties
$db->stdout and $db->stderr respectively.

Unlinks the output file and croaks on error.

Returns the full path of the file containining the backup.

Accepted parameters:

=over

=item format

The specified format, for example c for custom.  Defaults to plain text.

=item file

Full path of the file to which the backup will be written. If the file
does not exist, one will be created with umask 0600. If the file exists,
it will be overwritten, but its permissions will not be changed.

If undefined, a file will be created using File::Temp having umask 0600.

=item tempdir

The directory in which to write the backup file. Optional parameter.  Uses
File::Temp default if not defined.  Ignored if file parameter is given.

=item compress

Optional parameter. Specifies the compression level to use and is passed to
the underlying pg_dump command. Default is no compression.

=back

=cut

sub backup {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    $self->{stderr} = undef;

    return $output_filename;
}


=head2 backup_globals

This creates a file containing a plain text dump of global (inter-db)
objects, such as users and tablespaces.  It uses pg_dumpall to do this.

Being a plain text file, it can be restored using the run_file method.

Unlinks the output file and croaks on error.

Returns the full path of the file containining the backup.

Accepted parameters:

=over

=item file

Full path of the file to which the backup will be written. If the file
does not exist, one will be created with umask 0600. If the file exists,
it will be overwritten, but its permissions will not be changed.

If undefined, a file will be created using File::Temp having umask 0600.

=item tempdir

The directory in which to write the backup file. Optional parameter.  Uses
File::Temp default if not defined.  Ignored if file parameter is given.

=back

=cut

sub backup_globals {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    $self->{stderr} = undef;
    $self->{stdout} = undef;

    return $output_filename;
}


=head2 restore

After calling this method, STDOUT and STDERR output from the external
restore utility are available as properties $db->stdout and $db->stderr
respectively.

Croaks on error. Returns true on success.

Recognized arguments are:

=over

=item file

Path to file which will be restored to the database. Required.

=item format

The file format, for example c for custom.  Defaults to plain text.

=back

=cut

sub restore {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    $self->{stderr} = undef;
    $self->{stdout} = undef;

    croak 'Must specify file' unless defined $args{file};
    croak 'Specified file does not exist' unless -e $args{file};

    return $self->run_file(%args)
           if not defined $args{format} or $args{format} eq 'p';

    # Build command options
    my @command = ('pg_restore', '--verbose', '--exit-on-error');
    defined $args{format}   and push(@command, "-F$args{format}");
    defined $self->dbname   and push(@command, '-d', $self->dbname);
    push(@command, $args{file});

    $self->_run_command(command => [@command])
        or croak 'error running command';

    return 1;
}


=head2 drop

Drops the database.  This is not recoverable. Croaks on error, returns
true on success.

=cut

sub drop {
    my ($self) = @_;

    croak 'No db name of this object' unless $self->dbname;

    my @command = ('dropdb');
    push(@command, $self->dbname);

    $self->_run_command(command => [@command])
        or croak 'error running command';

    return 1;
}


=head1 CAPTURING

This module uses C<Capture::Tiny> to run extenal commands and capture their
output, which is made available through the C<stderr> and C<stdout>
properties.

This capturing does not work if Perl's standard C<STDOUT> or
C<STDERR> filehandles have been localized. In this situation, the localized
filehandles are captured, but external system calls are not
affected by the localization, so their output is sent to the original
filehandles and is not captured.

See the C<Capture::Tiny> documentation for more details.
