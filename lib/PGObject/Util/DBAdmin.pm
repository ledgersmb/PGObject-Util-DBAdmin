PGObject::Util::DBAdmin - PostgreSQL Database Management Facilities for
PGObject

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.100.0

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.100.0';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides an interface to the basic Postgres db manipulation
utilities.

 my $db = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new(
    username => 'postgres',
    password => 'mypassword',
    host     => 'localhost',
    port     => '5432',
    dbname   => 'mydb'
 );

 my @dbnames = $db->list_dbs(); # like psql -l

 $db->create(); # createdb
 $db->run_file(file => 'sql/initial_schema.sql'); # psql -f

 my $filename = $db->backup(format => 'c'); # pg_dump -Fc

 my $db2 = PGObject::Util::DBAdmin->new($db->export, (dbname => 'otherdb'));

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new db admin object for manipulating databases.

=head2 export

Exports the database parameters in a hash so it can be used to create another
object.

sub export {
    my $self = shift;
    return map {$_ => $self->$_() } qw(username password host port dbname)

=over

=item copy_of

Creates the new database as a copy of the specified one (using it as
a template). Optional parameter. Default is to create a database
without a template.

=back

=cut
